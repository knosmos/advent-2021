# Advent of Code 2021
My solutions to AoC 2021, written in Python. Each folder contains both parts

guarenteed to be optimal or efficient, as they have (for the most part)
been included unedited.

## Visualizations
Some solutions (currently days 9, 10, 11, 20, and 25) also
include visualizations built with pygame. Screenshots are below:
