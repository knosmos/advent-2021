# Advent of Code 2021
My solutions to AoC 2021, written in Python. Each folder contains both parts
of the problem, as well as the test data for that day's task. Solutions are not
guarenteed to be optimal or efficient, as they have (for the most part)
been included unedited. Some solutions (currently days 9 and 11) also
include visualizations built with pygame.
